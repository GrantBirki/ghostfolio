# ghostfolio 👻

A self-hosted version of Ghostfolio, deployed in Azure

## About ⭐

This project is made for easy self-hosting and deployment of your own Ghostfolio instance. It is designed to be deployed on a VM in Azure, but can be deployed anywhere that Docker (docker-compose) is supported. This project comes bundled with the following:

- [Terraform Configurations](./terraform) to help you get up and running with a standard VM in Azure
- [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yml) to run Ghostfolio and its dependencies
- [Caddy](./src/caddy) to automatically generate SSL certificates for your domain
- [Branch Deploy workflow](./.github/workflows/branch-deploy.yml) to help you ship changes to production (on your VM)

## Getting Started 🚀

First, ensure you read the [first time setup](./docs/first-time-setup-azure.md) guide.

Now that you have a VM setup in Azure land, SSH onto it and ensure you have a `.env` file (sourced from `.env.example`) in the root of the project.

Then, run the following command to start your Ghostfolio instance:

> Note: Before you run this command, ensure that you have a DNS record pointed to the static IP of your VM. This is required for the SSL certificate to be generated by [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)

```bash
script/deploy -b "main"
```

This will deploy the `main` branch of Ghostfolio

## Updating Ghostfolio 🔄

Once your project is fully setup, you will likely want to apply updates from the upstream repository of Ghostfolio. To do this, either wait for Dependabot to open a PR or open one yourself.

You can comment `.deploy` on the pull request to branch-deploy and test out the update before fully "committing" to the change and merging the branch into `main`
